                <h4><a href="deck.html">RED|BLACK :</a>   
                    A web-based card game created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that incorportes external APIs. 
                    The program fetches a deck of cards from API and then picks five cards from the deck each turn.
                    This game integrates Semantic UI framework to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface 
                    and has distinct sections for statistics, history, and cheats.</h4>
                <h4><a href="https://paryal58.github.io/Blackjack">BLACKJACK GAME :</a>  
                    A web-based BlackJack game created using React. This program makes use of external APIs to get a deck,
                    shuffle it and manage it. The program utilizes basic javascript functions to implement the standard BlackJack ruleset.</h4>
                <h4><a href="https://github.com/paryal58/chat_program">SIMPLE CHAT PROGRAM :</a>   
                    Multithreaded chat application that enables simultaneous message exchange between two program windows using Python's
                    socket and threading libraries. This program utilizes TCP/IP to establish reliable communication channel ensuring secure 
                    and consistent message delivery across different ports.</h4>
                <h4><a href="https://paryal58.github.io/calc">SIMPLE CALCULATOR : </a>   
                    A simple calculator app created using React. It utilizes javascript's math.js to perform neccessary calculations. </h4>
                <h4><a href="https://github.com/paryal58/dpll_solver">SAT SOLVER : </a>   
                    SAT solver that uses DPLL algorithm. The program utilizes unit propagation, which simplifies the CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) 
                    formula by deducing assignments for variables that appear in unit clauses. The algorithm then searches for unassigned variables 
                    within the formula and then recursively assigns truth values (either true or false) to these variables. If an assignment leads 
                    to a conflict where no clauses can be satisfied, the algorithm backtracks by unassigning the last variable and exploring other potential assignments. 
                    This recursive process continues until a satisfying assignment is found or all possibilities have been exhausted. </h4>
